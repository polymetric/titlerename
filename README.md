# titlerename

A Minecraft@Home community member by the name of Phillip_DE created a program that would take screenshots of our re-creations, then crop & scale them to match the original screenshot. When we took on more projects, we needed additional instances of the game to take screenshots continuously and update the live feed. The solution was to simply name the window the title of the server. That's what this Fabric mod is for. 1.16.5 only.
